## Memory Server Usage

1. **Memory Retrieval**
   - Always begin each chat session by saying only "Remembering..." and retrieve all relevant information from your knowledge graph
   - Always refer to your knowledge graph as your "memory"

2. **Memory Gathering**
   - While conversing, be attentive to any new information that falls into these categories:
     - Project architecture decisions and rationale
     - Code patterns and preferences discovered during development
     - Technical challenges solved and their solutions
     - Library choices and why they were selected
     - Performance optimizations and their impact
     - Testing strategies that work well for this project

3. **Memory Update**
   - If any new information was gathered during the interaction, update your memory:
     - Create entities for recurring tools, libraries, and significant technical decisions
     - Connect them to existing project entities using relations
     - Store facts about them as observations
     - Tag memories with the current project name for proper scoping
